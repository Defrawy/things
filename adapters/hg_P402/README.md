### rail_adapters_hgP405
You need to use the standard Rail from markku.
Adapters I designed have 52 mm distance between vertical plot of my crawler HG P402 and is plug & screw with Markku rail.

### matek_f405_wing
Probably the most affordable and high quality Flight Controllers with STMF4, strong psu for 5v adjustable with solder pads to 6, 7.2, 9v and 12v (these range <= 9v are particularly useful for increasing rotation speed of Rplidar A1)   
[ardupilot](http://ardupilot.org/) for plane, quad, rover, submarine etc or could use iNav firmware...

### gps_uM8N_wi_compass
a tiny baseplate for an classical GPS 32*32 here an ublox M8N.

Assembly is really easy and follow the rail guidelines add-on.
For printing, I'm using ABS Orange from Prusa or Extrudr Orange PETG.
